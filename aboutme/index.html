    <h2>Rachel Pazos</h2>
    Hi All!I'm Rachel & I'm an applied technology major. I'm really excited for this class.
    I have been a member of the church my whole life & I also served a mission. I live with 
    my husband and our children. I love spending time with my family. We like to travel and
    spend time outdoors. I love to read. I don't have much time to read so I started to listen 
    to audio books. That way I can listening to my books while getting my work done. I also
    love listening to podcasts. I listen to a lot of true crime or church podcasts. Here's
    to a wonderful semester for everyone!
